# troll-communities
An atempt to detect troll communities on Twitter.
For this purpose we selected a group of tweets regardind several journalists and Human Rights activists and studied the behaviour of accounts that mentioned them.
A structure of well defined opinion leaders (what literature defines as misinformating accounts) that replied or referred to at least one account and showed political bigotry towards them.
